## Get Started with Aspose.BarCode for Python via Java

1. Install Python, version >= 3.7.
2. You can install required dependencies globally or to local repository.
  - To install globally you can run script `setup_environment_global.py`.
  - To install environment to local repository, you can run script `setup_environment_local.py`.
It creates local_venv in the structure of project and pull in all required dependencies.
After that you should activate `local_venv` by launch
  ```bash
    local_venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
  - You also can install the library using PIP from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aspose-barcode-for-python-via-java/):
   ```bash
   pip install aspose-barcode-for-python-via-java
   ```
  To install certain version to global environment: 
   ```bash
   pip install aspose-barcode-for-python-via-java==24.11.0
  ```   
To install certain version to localrepository: 
   ```bash
   pip install aspose-barcode-for-python-via-java==24.11.0 --upgrade -t ./local_venv
  ```
